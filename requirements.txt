# Core Web Framework & Server
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
python-multipart # For file uploads

# Document Processing
python-docx         # For creating and manipulating .docx files
python-docx-template # For using .docx templates (if you use this library)
# mammoth            # Alternative for .docx to HTML (if needed for preview)
pdfplumber          # For extracting text and tables from PDFs
# PyMuPDF            # Alternative for PDF processing (often faster, more features)

# Image Processing (for OCR preprocessing, etc.)
# opencv-python-headless # For OpenCV image manipulation (headless is smaller)
# Pillow                 # Python Imaging Library

# AI / ML Model Interaction & Core Libraries
transformers[sentencepiece,torch] # Hugging Face Transformers core, sentencepiece for tokenizers, torch for PyTorch models
# accelerate # For efficient model loading/running on different hardware
# bitsandbytes # For 8-bit quantization (if running larger models)
# optimum[onnxruntime] # For ONNX model optimization and running (if you go this route)

# Natural Language Processing (might be pulled in by transformers, but good to be aware)
# nltk
# spacy

# API Interaction (if you call external services)
# requests
# httpx[http2] # Modern async HTTP client

# LangChain (if you use it for complex chains, summarization of long docs, etc.)
# langchain
# langchain-community
# langchain-openai # If using OpenAI models via LangChain

# Optional: For PDF generation from scratch (if not converting from DOCX)
# reportlab

# Optional: Database interaction (if not using Firebase solely)
# psycopg2-binary # For PostgreSQL
# pymongo         # For MongoDB

# For environment variable management in Python (good practice)
# python-dotenv
