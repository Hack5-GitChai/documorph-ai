ABSTRACT

This document is designed to test DocuMorph AI's ability to format a long academic report with mathematical equations and structured sections.

1. INTRODUCTION

In physics and mathematics, precise formatting of equations improves clarity and readability.

Equation: x2 + y2 = z2

This is known as the Pythagorean theorem, widely used in geometry.

2. CALCULUS BASICS

Integral calculus deals with accumulation. A common example is:

Equation: sqrt(x2 + y2)

This can represent distance from the origin in 2D space.

2.1 FRACTIONS AND RATIOS

Many scientific formulas use ratios and fractional values.

Equation: 1/2 + 3/4

This test helps ensure fractions are rendered in clean LaTeX.

3. CONCLUSION

DocuMorph AI should now classify headings, apply formatting, insert math images with captions, and generate a polished document.
